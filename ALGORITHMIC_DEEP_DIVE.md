**Focus**: Logic, algorithms, competitive advantages, novelty vs SOTA research

---

## üß† **CORE PROBLEM-SOLVING PARADIGMS**

### **Paradigm 1: Symbolic Program Synthesis (a_v4.py, hybrid)**

**Core Idea**: ARC tasks are transformations that can be expressed as compositions of symbolic operations

**Algorithm**:
```
1. Define DSL (Domain-Specific Language) of primitive operations
2. For each task, search the space of DSL compositions
3. Verify each candidate program against training examples
4. Return first program that perfectly fits all training pairs
```

**Search Strategy - Beam Search**:
```python
frontier = [[]]  # Start with empty program
for depth in 1..3:
    new_frontier = []
    for program in frontier:
        for operation in operator_pool:
            candidate = program + [operation]
            if verifies_on_training(candidate):
                return candidate  # Found solution!
            new_frontier.append(candidate)
    frontier = top_k(new_frontier, k=beam_width)  # Keep best k
```

**Key Insight**: Compositional structure - complex transformations = simple operations composed

**Competitive Advantage**:
- ‚úÖ Exact solutions when found (no approximation)
- ‚úÖ Interpretable programs
- ‚úÖ Generalizes perfectly if DSL captures the pattern

**Limitation**:
- ‚ùå Limited by DSL expressiveness
- ‚ùå Combinatorial explosion (mitigated by beam search)
- ‚ùå No learning across tasks

**Novelty vs Research**:
- Classic program synthesis approach (Gulwani et al. 2017)
- Beam search is heuristic-guided (better than pure brute force)
- Missing: Neural guidance (DreamCoder 2021), stochastic search (AlphaCode 2022)

---

### **Paradigm 2: LLM-as-Program-Generator (llm_solver_part1-4)**

**Core Idea**: Use LLM's pattern recognition to generate candidate DSL programs

**Algorithm**:
```
1. Serialize training examples as text
2. Prompt LLM: "Given these examples, write a DSL program"
3. Parse LLM output into executable DSL program
4. Verify program against training examples
5. If fails: Generate feedback, re-prompt LLM (Test-Time Adaptation)
6. Iterate until verified or max attempts
```

**Test-Time Adaptation Loop**:
```python
prompt = initial_prompt(task)
for attempt in 1..max_attempts:
    program = LLM(prompt)
    if verify(program, training_pairs):
        return program
    else:
        feedback = generate_feedback(program, training_pairs)
        prompt = prompt + feedback  # Add context for next attempt
```

**Key Insight**: LLM acts as heuristic for which programs to try (learned from vast code corpus)

**Competitive Advantage**:
- ‚úÖ Can generate creative, non-obvious solutions
- ‚úÖ Learns implicit patterns from pre-training
- ‚úÖ TTA allows self-correction

**Limitation**:
- ‚ùå Non-deterministic (different runs = different results)
- ‚ùå Requires LLM infrastructure
- ‚ùå Hallucination risk (generates invalid programs)

**Novelty vs Research**:
- Aligns with Codex/AlphaCode paradigm (LLM for code generation)
- TTA loop is Test-Time Training concept (Berman 2025 SOTA)
- **Novel aspect**: Tight verification loop (most LLM approaches are open-ended)

---

### **Paradigm 3: Feature-Driven Search (a_v4.py candidate enumeration)**

**Core Idea**: Infer features from training data to prune search space intelligently

**Algorithm**:
```
1. Analyze training pairs to infer features:
   - Size ratios (input vs output dimensions)
   - Size deltas (constant padding/cropping)
   - Color frequency (for fill colors)
   - Component structure (objects, backgrounds)
2. Generate candidates ONLY consistent with features
3. Search this constrained space
```

**Feature Inference Examples**:
```python
# If all pairs have output 2x larger than input:
infer_size_ratios(pairs) ‚Üí (2, 2)
‚Üí Generate candidate: [("tile", (2, 2))]

# If all pairs have output 3 pixels wider:
infer_size_deltas(pairs) ‚Üí (0, 3)
‚Üí Generate candidate: [("pad_crop", (0, 3, fill_color))]

# If all pairs preserve object but change position:
infer_object_motion(pairs) ‚Üí (dy=2, dx=-1)
‚Üí Generate candidate: [("translate", (2, -1, 0))]
```

**Key Insight**: Task-specific constraints dramatically reduce search space (10^6 ‚Üí 10^2 candidates)

**Competitive Advantage**:
- ‚úÖ Extremely efficient (10-100x faster than blind search)
- ‚úÖ Interpretable (features explain why candidates generated)
- ‚úÖ Robust (feature consistency = high confidence)

**Limitation**:
- ‚ùå Only works for "regular" patterns (consistent features)
- ‚ùå Fails on tasks with irregular/context-dependent transformations
- ‚ùå Handcrafted heuristics (doesn't adapt)

**Novelty vs Research**:
- Classical AI: Feature-based reasoning (1980s-2000s)
- **Novel**: Specific feature set tuned for ARC domain
- Missing: Learned feature extraction (neural networks)

## üî¨ **ALGORITHMIC COMPARISON**

### **a_v4.py Algorithm**:

```
solve_task(task):
    train_pairs = task.train

    # Strategy 1: Try pure palette remapping (fastest)
    palette_map = infer_global_palette_map(train_pairs)
    if palette_map verifies:
        return palette_map

    # Strategy 2: Feature-driven candidate generation
    candidates = []
    ratios = infer_size_ratios(train_pairs)
    if ratios:
        candidates.add([("tile", ratios)])
        for geom in geometries:
            candidates.add([("tile", ratios), ("geom", geom)])

    deltas = infer_size_deltas(train_pairs)
    if deltas:
        candidates.add([("pad_crop", deltas)])
        ...

    # Try all candidates (greedy search)
    for candidate in candidates:
        if verify(candidate, train_pairs):
            return candidate

    # Strategy 3: Beam search (if nothing found yet)
    operator_pool = build_operator_pool(train_pairs)  # Feature-driven
    return beam_search(train_pairs, operator_pool, beam=12, depth=3)
```

**Why This Works**:
1. **Hierarchical search**: Fast methods first (palette), expensive last (beam)
2. **Feature-driven pruning**: Only try plausible operations
3. **Exact verification**: Guarantees correctness when found

**Competitive Edge**:
- Solves ~20-35% of tasks (estimated)
- Fast (seconds per task)
- Deterministic (same result every run)

---

### **llm_solver (Gemini) Algorithm**:

```
solve_task(task):
    train_pairs = task.train

    # Create prompt with task examples
    prompt = f"""
    You are solving an abstract reasoning task.
    Training examples:
    {serialize_grids(train_pairs)}

    Express the transformation as a DSL program:
    Available operations: {DSL_DEFINITION}

    Output: [("operation1", params), ("operation2", params), ...]
    """

    # Test-Time Adaptation loop
    for attempt in 1..max_attempts:
        program_str = LLM(prompt)
        program = parse(program_str)

        if verify(program, train_pairs):
            return program

        # Generate feedback
        error = execute_and_compare(program, train_pairs[0])
        feedback = f"Your program failed: {error}. Try again."
        prompt = prompt + feedback

    return None  # Failed to find solution
```

**Why This COULD Work**:
1. **LLM pattern recognition**: Trained on vast code/pattern corpus
2. **Natural language reasoning**: Can handle complex, compositional rules
3. **Self-correction**: TTA loop allows learning from mistakes

**Current Gap**:
- ‚ùå Simulated LLM (not real)
- ‚ùå DSL is limited (14 ops vs a_v4's 30+)
- ‚ùå No actual validation of approach (never tested on real tasks)

**Potential Competitive Edge** (if implemented):
- Could solve tasks a_v4 can't (more creative reasoning)
- Could generalize better (learned patterns vs handcrafted)
- Expected: 25-35% (Berman 2025 showed 29.4% with similar approach)

## üéØ **KEY ALGORITHMIC INSIGHTS FROM EACH FILE**

### **From a_v4.py**:

**Insight 1: Multi-Strategy Orchestration**
```
Fast path (palette only)
    ‚Üì fail
Greedy search (feature-driven candidates)
    ‚Üì fail
Beam search (compositional exploration)
```
**Why**: Different tasks need different search depths

**Insight 2: Feature-Driven Operator Pool**
```python
# Don't search ALL operations for every task
# Only search operations consistent with observed patterns
if all_outputs_2x_larger:
    pool.add(tile_operation)
if all_outputs_same_size:
    pool.add(translate, palette, symmetrize)
    # Don't add tile, pad_crop (would fail)
```
**Why**: Reduces search from O(ops^depth) to O(relevant_ops^depth)

**Insight 3: Palette as Post-Processing**
```
Try program WITHOUT palette
    ‚Üì fail
Try program WITH palette
```
**Why**: Many tasks are "geometric transform + color remap"

### **From llm_solver_part4_tta_loop.py**:

**Insight 1: Feedback-Driven Evolution**
```python
attempt_1_program = LLM("solve this task")
if fails:
    feedback = "Your program output shape (5,5), expected (3,3)"
    attempt_2_program = LLM("solve this task. Previous attempt: {program}. Error: {feedback}")
```
**Why**: Gives LLM specific error signal (not just "wrong")

**Insight 2: Verification as Filter**
```
Generate N hypotheses ‚Üí Verify each ‚Üí Keep only verified
```
**Why**: LLMs hallucinate, verification ensures correctness

### **From Approach 2.py / Approach 3.py**:

**Insight: Pattern Analysis Heuristics**
```python
def analyze_pattern(input, output):
    # Check geometric relationships
    if is_rotation(input, output): return "rotate"
    if is_flip(input, output): return "flip"

    # Check size relationships
    if output.shape == input.shape * 2: return "tile"
    if output.shape == input.shape / 2: return "downsample"

    # Check color relationships
    if colors_changed(input, output): return "palette_map"
```
**Why**: Quick heuristics before expensive search

### **From arc_solver_hybrid.py**:

**Insight: Signature-Based Deduplication**
```python
def signature(program):
    # Apply program to canonical test grid
    test_grid = [[0,1,2],[3,4,5]]
    result = apply(test_grid, program)
    return tuple(result.flatten())

# Remove programs with same signature
seen = set()
for program in candidates:
    sig = signature(program)
    if sig not in seen:
        seen.add(sig)
        unique_candidates.append(program)
```
**Why**: Different DSL sequences can be equivalent (rotate90 4x = identity)

## üí° **ALGORITHMIC INNOVATIONS NEEDED FOR TRUE SOTA**

Based on analysis, here's what would make your solution competitive:

### **Innovation 1: Hybrid Search (Symbolic + LLM)**
```
For each task:
    # Phase 1: Fast symbolic search (a_v4 approach)
    candidates_symbolic = a_v4_search(task, max_time=30s)
    if any_verified(candidates_symbolic):
        return best(candidates_symbolic)

    # Phase 2: LLM-guided search
