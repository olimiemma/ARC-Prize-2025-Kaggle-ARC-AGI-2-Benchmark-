## üöÄ HOW TO SUBMIT TO KAGGLE

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

#### 1. Go to Kaggle Competition
```
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/arc-prize-2025
```

#### 2. Create New Notebook
- Click "Code" tab
- Click "New Notebook"
- **CRITICAL**: DELETE ALL default starter code!

#### 3. Attach Required Data
- Competition data: **arc-prize-2025** (should auto-attach)
- Add model dataset: Search for **"wb55L nemomini fulleval"**
  - Click "+ Add Data" in right sidebar
  - Search: "wb55L_nemomini_fulleval"
  - Add the dataset

#### 4. Copy-Paste Code
- Open `SOTA_ARC_SOLVER_KAGGLE_NOTEBOOK.py`
- Select ALL (Ctrl+A)
- Copy (Ctrl+C)
- Paste into empty Kaggle notebook cell (Ctrl+V)

#### 5. Verify Model Path
**IMPORTANT**: Check the model path in the code matches the dataset:
```python
MODEL_PATH = "/kaggle/input/wb55l-nemomini-fulleval/default"
```
Adjust if the actual dataset path is different (check right sidebar in Kaggle)

#### 6. Run the Notebook
- Click "Save Version"
- Select "Save & Run All (Commit)"
- Wait for execution (may take 1-3 hours for 240 tasks)

#### 7. Monitor Progress
- Watch output logs
- Look for "‚úÖ SUBMISSION COMPLETE!"
- Verify `submission.json` is created in Output

#### 8. Submit
- Click "Submit to Competition"
- Wait for score (10-30 minutes)
- Expected: **2-5%** (anything > 0% is success!)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Model Fails to Load:

**Symptom**: Error loading wb55L_nemomini_fulleval

**Solution**: Code has automatic fallback to Qwen-3-0.6b
- Check console output for "üîÑ Attempting fallback..."
- If Qwen also fails, check available models in Kaggle datasets

### If Model Path is Wrong:

**Symptom**: "FileNotFoundError: no model found"

**Solution**:
1. In Kaggle, check right sidebar "Data" section
2. Note the exact path shown
3. Update `MODEL_PATH` variable in Cell 1
4. Common paths:
   - `/kaggle/input/wb55l-nemomini-fulleval/`
   - `/kaggle/input/nemomini-fulleval/`

### If Score is 0%:

**Possible causes**:
1. Model didn't load correctly ‚Üí Check logs
2. Instruction executor not parsing correctly ‚Üí Check generated instructions in logs
3. Submission format wrong ‚Üí Verify submission.json structure

**Debug steps**:
1. Check execution logs for errors
2. Look at generated instructions (printed in console)
3. Verify at least some tasks show "‚úÖ VERIFIED!"

### If Out of Memory/Time:

**Symptom**: Kaggle timeout or OOM error

**Solution**: Reduce compute:
```python
# In EvolutionaryTTASolver initialization:
solver = EvolutionaryTTASolver(
    model=model,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    max_generations=2,  # Reduce from 3 to 2
    hypotheses_per_gen=3  # Reduce from 5 to 3
)
```

## üìä VALIDATION CHECKLIST

### Before Submission:
- [ ] Deleted all default Kaggle starter code
- [ ] Pasted SOTA_ARC_SOLVER_KAGGLE_NOTEBOOK.py
- [ ] Attached arc-prize-2025 dataset
- [ ] Attached wb55L_nemomini_fulleval model
- [ ] Verified MODEL_PATH is correct
- [ ] Saved version with "Save & Run All"

### During Execution:
- [ ] Model loads successfully (see "‚úÖ Model loaded")
- [ ] Tasks are being processed (see "üìã Task X/240")
- [ ] Some instructions verify (see "‚úÖ VERIFIED!")
- [ ] No critical errors in logs

### After Execution:
- [ ] See "üéâ SUBMISSION COMPLETE!"
- [ ] submission.json file created
- [ ] Submitted to competition
- [ ] Score > 0% üéØ

## üéØ EXPECTED RESULTS

### Realistic Expectations:
- **Minimum**: 0.5-1% (basic functionality)
- **Target**: 2-3% (matching/beating wb55L baseline)
- **Optimistic**: 3-5% (if evolutionary search works well)

### Success Criteria:
- ‚úÖ Score > 0% (anything beats previous 0% scores!)
- ‚úÖ Valid submission (no format errors)
- ‚úÖ Some tasks verified during execution

### Why This Will Work:
1. ‚úÖ Using proven model (wb55L: 2.08%)
2. ‚úÖ SOTA approach (Evolutionary TTA)
3. ‚úÖ Proper verification (exact match on training)
4. ‚úÖ Natural language (latest research validates)
5. ‚úÖ Multiple fallbacks (always generates valid output)

## üìù POST-SUBMISSION

### After Getting Score:

1. **Record Results** in SOTA_BUILD_LOG.md:
   ```
   Score: X.XX%
   Date: 2025-10-07
   Model: wb55L_nemomini_fulleval
   Approach: Evolutionary TTA
   ```

2. **Analyze Performance**:
   - If > 2%: SUCCESS! Better than baseline
   - If 0.5-2%: Good start, can optimize
   - If 0%: Debug needed (check logs)

3. **Potential Improvements** (if needed):
   - Expand instruction executor (more operations)
   - Increase hypotheses per generation
   - Add more sophisticated NLP parsing
   - Try different models (QwQ-32B, Gemma-3)

---

## üîç CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### Why This Should Beat 0%:

1. **Real LLM Integration** (not simulated)
2. **Proven Model** (wb55L has 2.08% score)
3. **Verification Loop** (only use instructions that work on training)
4. **Evolution** (learn from failures)
5. **Fallbacks** (always produce valid output)

### Why This Should Beat 2.08%:

1. **Better prompt engineering** (task-specific hypotheses)
2. **Evolutionary search** (not single-shot)
3. **Natural language** (research shows this works better)
4. **Multiple attempts** (pass@2 increases coverage)
