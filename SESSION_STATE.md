# Session State & Next Steps

**Date:** 2025-10-07
**Status:** ✅ LLM-based Solver Prototype Complete

---

### What We Accomplished Today

1.  **Initial Project Analysis:** We began by analyzing the existing project and determined that simply re-running a completed workflow was suboptimal. We pivoted towards critical review and improvement.

2.  **Hybrid Solver Creation:** We designed and implemented `arc_solver_hybrid.py`, a superior self-contained solver that merges the powerful engine of `a_v4.py` with the clean architecture of `KAGGLE_NOTEBOOK_READY.py`.

3.  **SOTA Solver Prototyping:** We then designed and built a complete, four-part prototype of a state-of-the-art **LLM-powered solver with a Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) loop**. This is a fully functional proof-of-concept.

### Where We Stopped

The implementation of the LLM+TTA solver prototype is **complete**. The entire workflow—from prompt generation to program verification and the self-correction feedback loop—is functional and demonstrated in `llm_solver_part4_tta_loop.py`.

The key point is that the interaction with the Large Language Model is currently **simulated** by the `_simulate_llm_call` function. This was done to prove the logic of the architecture without requiring a live API connection.

### Next Steps for Tomorrow

Tomorrow, the primary goal is to connect our prototype to a real Large Language Model. There are two main paths forward:

**Option A: Connect to an LLM API (Recommended First Step)**

This is ideal for rapid development and testing of our prompt and feedback logic.

- [ ] **Modify `_simulate_llm_call`:** Change the function in `llm_solver_part4_tta_loop.py` to make a real API call.
- [ ] **Choose an API:** You can use a service like Google's Gemini API, Anthropic's Claude, or OpenAI's GPT.
- [ ] **Add Dependencies:** You will need to install the required client library (e.g., `pip install google-generativeai`).
- [ ] **Manage API Key:** You will need to securely manage an API key.
- [ ] **Goal:** Validate that the prompts and feedback mechanism work effectively with a powerful, general-purpose reasoning engine.

**Option B: Adapt for Offline Kaggle Submission**

This is the path to creating a final, submittable Kaggle notebook.

- [ ] **Choose a Model:** Select a powerful open-source model from the Kaggle Models repository (e.g., Gemma, Llama 3, Mistral, or the ones seen in your screenshot).
- [ ] **Modify the Solver:** Update the `TTA_Solver` to load the chosen model and its tokenizer using a library like `transformers`.
- [ ] **Replace LLM Call:** Replace the `_simulate_llm_call` function with a new method that generates text using the locally-loaded model.
- [ ] **Package as a Notebook:** Combine all four Python scripts into a single Kaggle notebook.
- [ ] **Goal:** Create a self-contained, submittable notebook that can run offline and generate a `submission.json` file.

**Recommendation:** Start with **Option A** to quickly iterate and confirm the logic works with a real LLM. Once validated, proceed to **Option B** to adapt the proven logic for the Kaggle environment.

- **`llm_solver_part1_dsl_and_serializer.py`**: The foundation (DSL and Serializer).
- **`llm_solver_part2_prompt_engine.py`**: The prompt construction logic.
- **`llm_solver_part3_executor_and_verifier.py`**: The program execution and checking engine.
- **`llm_solver_part4_tta_loop.py`**: The main orchestrator with the **simulated LLM call** that you will modify.
