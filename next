  Easy Upgrades (Could add +5-10%)

  1. Expand DSL to 30-40 operations
    - Add object-level operations
    - More spatial transforms
  2. Increase composition depth to 3
    - Will increase runtime 3-5x
  3. Add simple heuristics
    - Prefer shorter programs
    - Boost frequently successful operations

  Hard Upgrades (Would need significant work)

  4. Add LLM integration (+10-15%)
    - Would need API access (violates Kaggle offline rule)
    - Or use local model (huge download, slow)
  5. Implement test-time training (+5-10%)
    - Would need training loop, significant compute
  6. Build ensemble (+3-5%)
    - Run multiple solvers, vote on outputs
  7. Full object-centric architecture (+5-8%)
    - Would need slot-attention model, training data
