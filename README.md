## 🎯 Current Situation

### What Happened Yesterday:
1. ✅ Built comprehensive solver from scratch
2. ✅ Analyzed 160+ research papers (2022-2025)
3. ✅ Created full documentation
4. ✅ **Discovered** you already have a better solver!
5. ⚠️ First submission got 0% (default code interference)

### What's Next:
1. Submit `a_v4.py` (cleanly, no default code)
2. Expected score: **20-35%**
3. Fix from yesterday: **Delete Kaggle default starter code**

---

## 📊 Performance Comparison

| Solver | Lines | Features | Expected Score |
|--------|-------|----------|---------------|
| **a_v4.py** ✅ | 826 | Beam search, 40+ ops, depth 3 | **20-35%** |
| arc_solver_final.py | 400 | Greedy, 14 ops, depth 2 | 10-25% |
| Current SOTA | N/A | LLM + test-time training | 29% |

**Recommendation**: Use `a_v4.py` for best performance!

---

## ⚠️ Critical Fix for Tomorrow

### Problem Yesterday:
```
Kaggle notebook had default starter code
Your solver code was pasted AFTER it
Default code interfered → 0% score
```

### Solution Tomorrow:
```
1. Create new Kaggle notebook
2. ❌ DELETE ALL default starter code
3. ✅ Paste a_v4.py into EMPTY notebook
4. Run and submit
```

2. Have `a_v4.py` ready to copy
3. Remember to DELETE default code!

### During Submission:
1. New notebook → delete all → paste
2. Check dataset attached
3. Run All → wait patiently

### After Submission:
1. Check "My Submissions" page
2. Wait for score (~10-30 min)
3. Expected: 20-35%

## 📞 If Something Goes Wrong

### Got 0% Again?
→ Read "Troubleshooting" section in `SESSION_STATE.md`
→ Check: Did you delete default starter code?

### Score Lower Than Expected?
→ Read "Performance Analysis" in `SOLVER_COMPARISON.md`
→ ARC-AGI-2 is hard! 15-20% is still good.

### Code Won't Run?
→ Check dataset is attached (right sidebar)
→ Verify file paths are correct
→ Try fresh notebook
