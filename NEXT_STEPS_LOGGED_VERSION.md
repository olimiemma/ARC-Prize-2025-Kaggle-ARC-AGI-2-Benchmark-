# üîç NEXT STEPS - Using Logged Version

**Date**: 2025-10-08
**Status**: Need to identify WHY solver is failing

---

## üìä **CURRENT SITUATION**

**HYBRID_SOTA_ARC_SOLVER_FIXED.py ran for 93 minutes:**
- ‚úÖ No crashes
- ‚úÖ Completed all 120 tasks
- ‚ùå **0% score** (all 171 test cases failed)
- ‚ùå **NO error messages** (production version has no logging)

**Problem**: We can't see WHY it's failing!

---

## ‚úÖ **SOLUTION: Use Logged Version**

Created: `HYBRID_SOTA_ARC_SOLVER_LOGGED.py`

**What it adds:**
- Prints when candidates are generated
- Prints which tier succeeds/fails
- **Prints errors from DSL operations**
- Shows WHY verification fails

---

## üöÄ **WHAT TO DO NOW**

### **Step 1: Upload Logged Version**

1. Go to Kaggle notebook
2. **Replace** current code with: `HYBRID_SOTA_ARC_SOLVER_LOGGED.py`
3. Keep same setup:
   - bitsandbytes installed
   - GPU T4 x2
   - Same datasets/models
4. **Run on 10 tasks only** (for quick debugging)

---

### **Step 2: Look for Error Messages**

The logged version will print:
```
[T1] Generated 28 candidates
[ERROR] Op keep_largest_nonbg(0,): name 'bg' is not defined
[ERROR] Op pad_crop(2, 3, 0): could not broadcast...
[T1] All candidates failed
```

**This will tell us EXACTLY what's broken!**

---

### **Step 3: Share the Output**

Copy the console output showing:
- First 2-3 tasks
- The error messages
- Stats at end

---

## üí° **EXPECTED RESULTS**

**If "bg" bug is still there:**
```
[ERROR] Op keep_largest_nonbg(0,): name 'bg' is not defined
```
‚Üí Means the fix didn't apply correctly

**If another bug:**
```
[ERROR] Op pad_crop(...): <some other error>
```
‚Üí We'll fix that specific bug

**If no errors but still failing:**
‚Üí Indicates verification logic issue or LLM tier problem

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è **QUICK TEST**

**For debugging, modify the code to run on 10 tasks only:**

Find line ~90:
```python
# Progress reporting
REPORT_EVERY = 20
```

Add after it:
```python
DEBUG_MAX_TASKS = 10  # Test on 10 tasks only
```

Find line ~900 (in main loop):
```python
for task_idx, (task_id, task_data) in enumerate(tasks.items(), 1):
```

Add after it:
```python
    if task_idx > DEBUG_MAX_TASKS:  # Stop after 10 tasks
        break
```

This way the test runs in ~8 minutes instead of 93 minutes.

---

## üìù **WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR**

When you run the logged version, share:

1. **The error messages** (if any)
2. **Number of candidates generated** per task
3. **Which tier is running** (should see T1, T2, maybe T3)
4. **Final stats** after 10 tasks

This will tell me exactly what to fix!

---

## ‚ö° **TL;DR**

1. Upload `HYBRID_SOTA_ARC_SOLVER_LOGGED.py` to Kaggle
2. Add `DEBUG_MAX_TASKS = 10` limit for quick testing
3. Run it (~8 minutes)
4. Copy ALL console output
5. Share with me
6. I'll identify the exact bug
7. Create final fixed version
8. Submit and get your 15-25% score! ‚úÖ
