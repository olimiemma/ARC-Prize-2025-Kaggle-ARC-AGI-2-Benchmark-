Final Approach Explanation

Method overview

- Core: A symbolic micro-DSL over grid operations with feature-driven guided search and exact verification on train pairs.
- Two attempts per test input:
  - attempt_1 (palette-first): seek a global palette map; if not, try geometry/tile/pad + palette.
  - attempt_2 (geometry-first): prefer exact structural fits without palette; otherwise allow palette.
- Deterministic, schema-correct outputs; safe fallbacks ensure every item has two attempts.

Implemented operations (V2)

- Geometry: rotate90/180/270, flip_h, flip_v, transpose.
- Scale/tiling: tile(hr, wr) based on consistent integer ratios inferred from train pairs.
- Shape change: pad_crop_center(dh, dw, fill) using consistent deltas inferred from train pairs and a stable fill color (mode over train outputs).
- Palette: global bijective mapping inferred and merged across train pairs; applied post-ops.

Search and verification

- Candidate enumeration is bounded and feature-driven:
  - Geometry-only sequences (length 1â€“2).
  - Tile and pad/crop, optionally combined with a single geometry op.
- Verification is exact on train pairs; palette mapping is merged across pairs when enabled.
- Duplicate programs are avoided via simple sequence de-duplication.

Evaluation and runtime

- Local harness mirrors Kaggle scoring (pass@2). CLI provided in versions/arc_solver_v1.py and versions/arc_solver_v2.py.
- Runtime is CPU-friendly; no external models or internet required.

Limitations and next steps

- Missing richer operations (connected components, masks, symmetry detectors, translation) that are often required for harder ARC tasks.
- No learned priors or rankers; search breadth is modest. V3 should add component ops, translation via centroid/bbox deltas, simple masks, and caching.
- Future: integrate a small packaged ranker or heuristic tie-breaker; add canonicalization of geometry compositions; expand parameterization for pad/translate; improve prior selection.
